<p>Hodari Digital loves developers. Like, heart-pounding, chest-thumping, breathless love.</p>

<p>Care to play matchmaker?</p>

<p>We’ll give you ZAR 10,000 if you refer us to a developer who makes us feel that way.</p>

<h5>
<a id="why-should-developers-love-hodari-digital" class="anchor" href="#why-should-developers-love-hodari-digital" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should developers love Hodari Digital?</h5>

<p>Because we maintain a company culture that fosters autonomy and transparency. Because we keep meetings to a minimum, and we work on projects that make a difference in people's lives, all over the world, all with the support and camaraderie of a small, dedicated team.</p>

<p>Specifically, we’re looking developers who:</p>

<ul>
<li>Love Autonomy: Our one overriding rule is “use good judgment.” So we’re looking for people who like to push their own projects forward, and want to contribute to our vision, mission, and goals.</li>
<li>Love Shipping Code: The pace we maintain on the product team is incredibly high. .</li>
<li>Love Big Projects: Our team is fully empowered to solve for the needs of our customers, so you don’t have to wade through red tape or permission slips to get things done. We just figure out what’s the right thing to do, and then we do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Know somebody who sounds like this? You lucky, lucky devil.</p>

<p>Introduce us. Please?  The person you are referring must actually know you when we contact them. It can't be a surprise to them. No one likes uncomfortable moments with strangers. Awkward, we are not keen.</p>

<p>If you do, and we end up hiring them, we’ll thank you with a big, fat check for ZAR 10,000.</p>

<p>That’s right. Ten thousand clams.</p>

<h5>
<a id="the-rules-are-yes-there-are-rules" class="anchor" href="#the-rules-are-yes-there-are-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The rules are (yes there are rules):</h5>

<ul>
<li>Please don’t refer yourself (feel free to apply the usual way, though.) </li>
<li>The person you are referring must actually know you when we contact them. No one likes uncomfortable moments with strangers. </li>
<li>This applies to Engineering (Developer) positions only. Oh, and did we mention, that they need to be <em>awesome</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>The fine print is that we will pay you 120 days after the person has held a full time Engineering position with us and they are doing awesome.</p>

<p>You must be the first person to refer the candidate from any source. By submitting the email below, we will record the date and time of submission along with the candidate's name.</p>

<p>Our decision on who submitted first will be final but because we get lots of referrals, we can’t tell you if you are first until we actually contact/hire the person.</p>

<p>Unlike diamonds, your referral doesn’t last forever. If we can’t meet with the referral within thirty days or we don’t hire them within six months after you submit their name, no bonus will be paid.</p>

<p>The rest is up to you.</p>

<p><em>We can decide to stop this program or change the rules at any time. If we do, we'll post them on this page.</em></p>

<a id="the-person" class="anchor" href="#the-person" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The person</h4>

<p>We looking for someone who wants to take the world by storm. They need to be ready to lead the tech stack development. Think startup with runway, that's us.</p>

<p>We are focusesd on 2 streams, services and products. Services will include social, search etc, and the tech team will need to lead some of the development in supporting products that give us a competitive edge. </p>

<p>These products will be SAAS, and indeed could be standalone business's.</p>

<p>Products will be websites and applications. We have historically come from wordpress, and we will need to remain with it, as it is opening up, but we need someone who can take it to the next level, such as using a react or angular framework to power the frontend and to use javascript when and where we need to.</p>

<p>As an example, we are currently running the Wordpress API to power child sites and to keep the terms &amp; conditions up to date across 15 sites...</p>

<p>I also want someone who is comfortable with Node.js, as we are looking at a company we may purchase with a existing product, and the tech lead would need to handle the product improvments.</p>

<p>Also you won't develop everything, each project will be evaluated, and you may project manage it with external teams.</p>

<p>We run like a software company, using slack, trello, and standups to drive the business forward, but we think like creatives, so anything needs to be at least possible in theory...</p>

<p>The candidate would lead the development of the team under them, and the </p>

<p>We don't do average. We want a rockstar, who can achieve 10x productivity, and more importantly inspire it, however we have a no asshole rule</p>
